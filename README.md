# ToDoList
A to-do list created with html, css, and javascript
An interactive to-do list. The site simply prompts you to type and submit a task which is then added to your to-do list. 
In this list you have two options:
  -You can edit a specific task by clicking on the "EDIT" button. 
  -Once finished with the task, you can delete it from the list by clicking the "DELETE" button. 
 To make this site eye-catching I included icons, colored fonts, and user friendly formatting.
